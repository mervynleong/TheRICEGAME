Project of a "Doodle God" inspired game called "The Rice Game"
This game takes inspiration from "Doodle God's" elements' of selecting 2 items and dragging them to each other and produce a by-product.
Each by-product can mix with other by-products/ elements to be able to produce new by-products.
Doodle god may not have a win/lose condition as they only have a completion bar or checker per se.

However, The Rice Game has a win/lose condition.
